2048 Merging Strategic Game
Overview
This is a strategic puzzle game inspired by the popular 2048 game. The game involves merging grid boxes where powers of 2 appear. The goal is to merge the boxes by dragging and dropping tiles with the same number to create larger powers of 2, eventually reaching 2048 or beyond. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the game features real-time user interactions and dynamic game state updates.

Technologies Used

CSS: Styled the game grid and boxes for a visually appealing, responsive design.
JavaScript: Handled game logic, user interactions, drag-and-drop functionality, and real-time DOM manipulation for updates.
How to Play
Powers of 2 appear in the grid boxes.
Drag a tile and drop it onto another tile with the same number to merge them into a larger power of 2 (e.g., 2 + 2 = 4, 4 + 4 = 8).
Continue merging tiles to reach the highest possible numberâ€”ideally 2048 or higher.
The game is over when no more valid moves can be made on the grid.
